# SageMaker-Healthcare-Domain-Expert

## Context of the project
This repository houses a proof-of-concept (POC) project titled "Enhancing Healthcare Communication with AI", which explores the potential of fine-tuning large language models using SageMaker for the healthcare domain. The project aims to equip students with advanced machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) skills by developing a healthcare domain expert model. By leveraging AWS tools, students train a language model capable of generating informative and contextually relevant text responses specific to healthcare. The project emphasizes rigorous evaluation, comparing the fine-tuned model against the original to validate its effectiveness, serving as a valuable resource for building high-quality healthcare-focused ML solutions.

## About the project
This project focuses on developing a domain expert model tailored for the healthcare field. It employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to train and deploy a large language model on AWS SageMaker. The resulting model should be capable of generating informative and contextually relevant text responses specific to healthcare topics.

## Dataset Used
The dataset chosen for this project revolves around a specific area within healthcare. For example, you could focus on:

Clinical trials: Publicly available clinical trial data can provide valuable information on diseases, treatment protocols, and patient outcomes.
Medical journals: Peer-reviewed medical journals contain the latest research findings and clinical practices.
De-identified patient cases: Anonymized case reports offer real-world insights into complex medical presentations, diagnoses, and treatment decisions.
The specific dataset selection will depend on the chosen area of healthcare expertise for the model. This dataset serves as the training ground for fine-tuning the language model to become a healthcare domain expert in text generation.

##Steps Used in the Project
Dataset Selection: 
Select a dataset relevant to the chosen healthcare domain. Ensure the data is copyright-free or has appropriate licenses for use in training an LLM.

Environment Configuration:
Configure an AWS SageMaker IAM Role to provide the necessary permissions for accessing AWS resources.
Set up an AWS SageMaker Notebook Instance for developing and running code.
Request a GPU instance (e.g., ml.g5.2xlarge) suitable for fine-tuning the language model.

Fine-tuning the Language Model:
Deploy the Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model on the AWS platform.
Utilize Python scripts to fine-tune the model on the selected healthcare domain dataset. This enhances the model's understanding of healthcare-specific language and concepts.

Model Deployment:
Deploy the fine-tuned language model on SageMaker to make it accessible for generating text.

Testing and Evaluation:
Test and evaluate the deployed model for its ability to respond to domain-specific healthcare knowledge and generate text relevant to the chosen healthcare area. Conduct a comparative analysis between the fine-tuned model and the original model to assess the impact of fine-tuning on domain performance.
Technologies Used

Amazon SageMaker: This fully managed service provides the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly.

Meta Llama 2 7B Model: The foundation model for fine-tuning. This pre-trained model for text generation tasks will be adapted to the healthcare domain.

Python: Used extensively for scripting and interacting with AWS services, including SageMaker.

AWS Services: The project leverages various AWS services, including:

IAM (Identity and Access Management) for secure access control.
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for requesting GPU instances for model training.
S3 (Simple Storage Service) for storing datasets and model artifacts.

## Comparative Analysis
The project includes a comparative analysis between the fine-tuned and deployed models to assess performance, validating the effectiveness of fine-tuning on healthcare-specific data.
